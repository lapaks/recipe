Provides Widget support for the [BreadCrumb NavXT Plugin](http://mtekk.weblogs.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/)

== Description ==

The BreadCrumb NavXT Widget Plugin is a solution I developed for the [BreadCrumb NavXT Plugin](http://mtekk.weblogs.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/).
The original plugin is absolutely wonderful, but requires users to insert the plugin's function call directly into their current theme
to display the breadcrumb navigation.  This plugin simply creates a widget for the breadcrumb so that users can easily insert it into their site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bcnavxt-widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or use [OneClick Installer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/oneclick/)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. A widget called "BreadCrumb NavXT Widget" should appear on your 'Widgets' page under 'Design'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin include BreadCrumb NavXT? =

No.  This widget has been release separately from the [BreadCrumb NavXT Project](http://mtekk.weblogs.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/).
If you want to download it, or have questions related to the BreadCrumb NavXT plugin itself, please refer 
to [http://mtekk.weblogs.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/](http://mtekk.weblogs.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/).

= Can I use this plugin or its code on my site? =

Yes, please do.  You can do almost anything you want with any portion of this plugin.  Just make sure you adhere to the
